# Password_protected_door_lock_system-Arduino
In this project  we have designed Password Protected Door Lock System Using Arduino & Keypad. As thefts are increasing day by day security is becoming a major concern nowadays. So a digital code lock can secure our home or locker easily. It will open our door only when the right password is entered.

Circuit of this project is very simple which contains Arduino, keypad module, Servo Motor,Potentiometer,resistor and LCD. Arduino controls the complete processes like taking a password form the keypad module, comparing passwords,rotating servo motor, and sending status to the LCD display. The keypad is used for taking the password. Servo motor is used for opening the gate while rotating and LCD is used for displaying status or messages on it.
